# hello-world
A repository thing!
Guess this is an interesting way of fixing up my code, and keeping track of changes! I like what I see so far! What do I do if I have a shit ton of stuff and it's all in one paragraph? Is it marked with a bar on the side?

Is every paragraph marked with a new color bar?
